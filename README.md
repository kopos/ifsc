# ifsc

A simple microservice to help validate IFSC codes.

Based on the amazing [IFSC dataset][dataset] provided by [RazorPay][repo], this is a clojure micro-service providing only 3 API endpoints. The API end points closely mimic the Elixir server supplied in the [RazorPay Repo][repo]

IFSC data is stored in an embedded H2 database (ifsc.db) in the repo itself.

Few other data related to branches are loaded from files into atoms.

## Usage

* Compile with `lein uberjar`

* Run with `PORT=<PORT> java -jar target/*-standalone.jar`

* Make curl calls to
  * `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/v1/ifsc/:code `
  * `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/v1/ifsc/:code/validate`
  * `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/v1/banks/:code`
